## 🥷 About Me
- 🎓️ I'm currently pursuing Diploma in Computer Engineering.
- 🖥️ I'm a tech enthusiast who loves to experiment with new tools and technologies.
- 🍁 I enjoy working on new projects, as well as improving existing projects.
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I use Arch Linux *btw* because it supports *NVIDIA 340.xx* drivers seamlessly. There's more to it than this though.
